# Files

This directory contains a set of unchanging Java
classes and jars/wars, as test fodder for parsing
routines.  It's purely data, and not a part of
the build of the project, except that test cases use it.

Yes, it's unusual to see jars and .class files checked
into a repository, but in this case they're purely data files.
